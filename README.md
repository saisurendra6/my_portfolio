# MyPortfolio Flutter Web App

A modern, responsive, and visually stunning personal portfolio website built with Flutter Web. This project lets developers, designers, and tech professionals elegantly showcase their skills, projects, certifications, education, and experience—with theming (dark/light), beautiful UI, and smooth navigation.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**: Looks beautiful on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Light/dark mode toggle with animated theme transitions.
- **Clean Navigation**: Website-style fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling and a right-side drawer menu on mobile.
- **Rich Showcase**: Sections for About, Projects, Skills, Education, Certifications, Experience, and Contact.
- **Data-Driven**: All content (projects, skills, certifications, etc.) is defined via Dart models for easy updates.
- **Modern Animations**: Subtle hover and transition effects throughout for premium UX.
